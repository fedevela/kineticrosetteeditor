# Kinetic Rosette Patterns and Tessellations

An interactive visualization and design environment for exploring rosette patterns and their tessellations through geometric transformation.

## Overview

Rosette patterns are geometric figures characterized by rotational symmetry about a central point. This system implements the mathematical framework described in Beatini's research on kinetic rosette patterns, allowing users to interactively generate, modify, and analyze these structures.

The system operates across three hierarchical compositional levels:

### Level 1: Seed Shape

The foundation of the rosette is a user-editable plane curve defined by control points. This seed geometry can be manipulated through its handles to create the base motif. The system maintains bilateral symmetry constraints about the orientation axis.

### Level 2: Rosette Pattern

A rosette is generated by rotating the seed shape through cyclic replications. The key parameter is the **order** (n), which determines the number of equally-spaced rotations around a central point. The mathematics involves:

- **Rotational symmetry group**: Cyclic group C_n with rotations at angles 2π/n
- **Mirror adjacency**: Optional reflection of successive motifs to create alternate pattern types
- **Angular positioning**: Control of the base shape's orientation via azimuthal rotation

Orders range from 4 to 120, generated as multiples of base values (4-12), enabling exploration of both small and highly complex symmetries.

### Level 3: Tessellation and Tiling

Rosette patterns are composed into larger periodic tilings through spatial repetition. The system supports:

- **Translation lattices**: Regular translational arrays with customizable spacing
- **Ring-based composition**: Radial arrangements of rosette cells around a central motif
- **Multi-ring configurations**: Up to 4 nested rings for hierarchical structure analysis

## Features

- **Real-time visualization**: Dynamic rendering of rosette patterns as parameters change
- **Curve editing**: Manipulate seed shapes through vertex-based control points
- **Parametric control**: Adjust symmetry order, mirror properties, line thickness, and cell spacing
- **Layered composition**: Build tessellations from individual rosette motifs
- **Fold animation**: Kinetic visualization of pattern transformation between states

## Technical Implementation

This is implemented as a web-based interactive system using modern browser technologies, enabling visualization and analysis without requiring specialized academic software.
